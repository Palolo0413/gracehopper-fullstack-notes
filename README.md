##<a name="latest"></a>  2. 
- second update: 12/14/2016
	- I've added notes for the junior phase review session that Joe did with GH on Monday. 

- initial update: 12/11/2016
	- Notes are now up in their raw form.
	- There are a few workshops and lectures that I didn't take notes for. Those will be available once I've reviewed those modules, but I can't guarantee that will happen before next week. 

##<a name="coming"></a>  Coming updates: 
- At some point before the end of December, I will write a program to convert my notes for me from .js (and .html, and .sql) format to Github's .md format, so you will be able to read my notes right in the browser, without having to clone the repo to your computer and open it in a text editor. 

##<a name="howto"></a>  For now, the easiest way to use these notes is: 
- `git clone https://github.com/csjiang/gracehopper-fullstack-notes.git` 
- Open in the text editor of your choice. 
- For finding a particular topic or section, *cmd + F* and *cmd + shift + F* are your friends. 
- There is much more organization and detail in some of the later notes than in the former ones. I am especially proud of my notes on the React/Redux series, so do check those out. :) 
- In most of the files, I've indicated in comments the portions that are pre-reading notes, lecture notes, workshop notes, and review notes.
- **Bonus:** Some of my files are already in .md format, so YOU CAN READ THEM RIGHT ON GITHUB! Check it out: **[Week 4 jQuery notes](./week4-notes/notes_jQuery.md)**, **[week 5 es6 notes](./week5-notes/notes_es6.md)**

##<a name="plox"></a>  My requests to you: 
- If you happen across any errors or egregious oversights, please let me know in a pull request or over Slack (**@christinejiang**).
- Ditto for any suggestions that you have/feedback about what you found useful or not-so-useful in the formatting and organization of these notes.
- If you found these notes helpful, please tell your friends/classmates! 

# Happy studying!
