chrome dev tools: 
you can view default styles for h1 tag 
blue highlighting: represents content itself
green: padding/borders
yellow: margin highighting. Space inbtw border and other elements. 


css props:
width/height: can be styled in px, % + view height (vh) -- latter two used for responsive styling
display
margin/padding
border
text-align
color

font-size (px, % or vh)

CSS selectors
.class
#id
* --> selects all eleemnts
div,p --> selects all <div> elmts and all <p> elmts
div p --> selects all <p> elmts inside <div> elmts
div>p --> selects all <p> elmts that are child of <div> 


      ul {
          list-style: none; 
          padding: 0;

          list-style none --> without bullets.

//Bootstrap: a collection of HTML, CSS and JS files for styling 

installation 2 ways: 
1)  download bootstrap.css and link to that file in HTML: put following in header-
<link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "bootstrap.css">

2) use a CDN to download bootstrap whenever page loads: 
<link rel= "stylesheet" type="text/css" href = "...bootstrap.min.css">

Using CDN, page will take extra time to load and will not be available offline. But libraries load fast if there are just a few, and CDN can reduce bloat inside project + it is easier to keep libraries updated.

//CSS box model:
content, padding, border, margin, other elmts

setting WIDTH property of an elmt will change area of elmt's content box. 
- by default, width is only calc'd by content box; does not take padding/border into account.

"box-sizing" property: can change how width is calculated. 

html {
	box-sizing: 'border-box'
} --> changes calc of width of elmt to include padding and border. Gaining in popularity now. 

DevTools' 'elements' tab lets you study Box model for each elmt in HTML file. 

use margin-left/right: auto to center elmts
in most instances, setting to "auto" means "take up as much space as possible" 


//Block vs inline elements: 
block elements  
	- start on a new line
	- HEIGHT/WIDTH: 
		-width: take up max width available.
			-(not necess to set width/give it 100% width to make it fill parent horizontally.)
			- if no width is set, will expand naturally to fit its parent container
		- height: if no height is set, will expand naturally to fit child elements (assuming child elmts are not floated or positioned) 
	- assuming no floats/positioning on surrounding elmts, by default, will be placed BELOW prev elmts in markup. 
		//not necessary to "clear" it; assuming no floats are affecting it, it will "clear" automatically and will start on next "line" in page's output. 
	- VERTICAL-ALIGN: ignores vertical-align property
	- MARGINS/PADDING: can have margins/padding
	- EXAMPLES: h1-h5, div, p, ul, header, nav, li, form 
		structural elements

inline elements
	- "a box that acts like text"
	- occur inline w rest of elmts/text
	- will not clear previous content to drop to next line like block lements
	- subject to white-space settings in CSS 
	- MARGINS/PADDING: ignores top and bottom margin settings, but applies left/right margins and any padding. 
	- HEIGHT/WIDTH: ignores width and height properties. 
	- VERTICAL-ALIGN: is subject to vertical-align property. 
	- if floated L or R, will automatically become a block-level elmt subject to all block characteristics. 
	- only take up as much width as necessary
	- EXAMPLES: span, a, em, i, b, cite, mark, code
		text-based elements

nesting: 
	- any block elmt can go inside another block elmt. 
	- any inline elmt can go inside a block elmt. 
	- block elmts CANNOT go inside inline elmts
		exception: <a> elmt can be wrapped around any content. 

by default, <li> items are block elmts. 
DevTools will tell you that each takes up full width of its parent element. 

To change inline/block/inline-block display: 
CSS "display" property.
//important note: CSS makes block and inline distinction but from HTML5 perspective there is more granular categorization: see content models 

//inline-block
	makes elmt generate a block box laid out as if it were an inline box. preserves block capabilities such as setting width, height, top and bottom margins/paddings. 

	//uses: 
	- fix IE6 double-margin bug on floated elmts - margins on same side as direction of float will result in doubled margin. 
	- place multiple block-like elmts on same horiz line w/o floating them
	- allow inline elmt to have width/height while remaining inline
	- allow inline elmt to have padding/margins 

	//nb: 
	- inline-block elmts are white-space dependent; if you use inline-block in a list (e.g. in nav bar) list items will have unwanted space next to each other. 
	- for stuff w variable heights and all inline-block, will need to add vertical-align: top to make sure alignments are not staggered.

compatibility hack for inline block: 
.myclass {
	display:inline-block;
	*display:inline;
	zoom:1;
}

//replaced elements: 
	- neither block nor inline. 
	- kind of like inline elmts but with block-like structure. 
	- elmts whose appearance and dimensions are defined by an external resource. 
	- can have intrinsic dimensions- eg if img elmt has width set to auto, width will come from the linked image file itself. 
		intrinsic dimensions also define ratio for scaling 
			in case only width is specified for instance, height will come from this intrinsic ratio. 
	- can also have visual formatting requirements imposed by the elmt outside of the control of CSS. 
	- EXAMPLES: img, form elmts (button, input, select, textarea), object 

	** for non-replaced inline elmts, amt of space taken up (contribution to line height) is determined by the line-height property, NOT the border and padding even though they appear visually around the content.

//border-style: top right bottom left 
//can have diff styles for difft sides. 
- dotted
- dashed
- solid
- double
- groove (3d grooved; effect depends on border color value) 
- ridge (3d ; effect depends on border color value) 
- inset (3d; "")
- outset (3d; "")
- none 
- hidden

//border-width: top right bottom left.
//can be set as a size (px, pt, cm, em, etc) or w three predefined vals: thin, medium, or thick. 

//border-color: top right bottom left. 
//can be set by name ("red"), hex ("#ff0000"), rgb("rgb(255,0,0)"), transparent
//if not set, it inherits color of elmt.

//border-top-style: //can style border indiv sides like so

//border-style: dotted solid double; 
--> top is dotted, l/r solid, bottom double
//border-stle: dotted solid;
--> top and bottom dotted; l/r solid. 

//border: 5px solid red; (this is width, style and color in one)

//font-size: 
//can be set with defaults ("medium [default], xx-small, small, xx-large, smaller [than parent elmt]"), length(px, cm, etc), % (percent of parent elmt font-size), initial (default), inherit(from parent) 

//float: 
//eg navbar-right = float to right
//inline blocks: elmt still has height but can have mulitple blocks on one line. this is like what bootstrap does w rows and columns. 

---- POSITION ----
//position can also be "fixed"
//position: relative; 
//can position relative to where it was originally 

//(default = static; wherver an elmt ends up in the flow of doc given order/display properties. 
//top: 100px; (moves down from top 100px) 
left: 50px; (moves to right 50px; )
//will leave a gap where it once was

//position: absolute; 
//top: 100px; (moves down from top 100px) 
left: 50px; (moves to right 50px; )
//positions it relative to closest relatively-positioned parent element; if none exists it just is positioned relative to the body/document itself.  
//will not leave a gap where it once was

---- Using absolute and relative positioning together ----

Page elmt w relative positioning gives you ctrl of absolutely positioning children elmts inside it.

If you forget rel postning on parent the child elmts will absolutely position themselves relative to the body element. 

pros of using absolute positioning: 
 	- good cross-browser support
 	- less dependence on floats
 	- less dependence on margins, which are buggy w old IE

cons of absolute positioning: 
	- positioned elmts removed from natural doc flow
	- can cause maintenance problems if you have to add other elmts near positioned one. 

//defining dimensions of absolutely positioned elmt /o width or height: 

.box {
	position: relative;
	width: 400px;
	height: 400px;
}

.inner-box {
	position: absolute; 
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
} --> causes inner elmt to fill outer elmt's content area.
