// We've made a Node library called volleyball that does essentially what you've just built. 
//Volleyball is an example of application-level middleware. Passing it to app.use() makes it intercept all requests. 
//So every time a client communicates with the server, Volleyball logs a summary. 
//Volleyball also logs when your server sends a response, and related info like content-length and content-type.

// Volleyball is purpose-built for students to learn how HTTP servers work asynchronously, 
//but almost certainly isn't used in any production apps. Instead, the industry standard is 
//morgan, by the Express team. Morgan logs only upon response, merging in request info. 
//That's more compact, but somewhat misleading. Morgan is more powerful and configurable 
//than Volleyball, however.


// `request.query` vs `request.params`:

// *request.params* act like _parameters_ in that so long as there is a _string_ in the 
// appropriate location it will hit that route (e.g. both `/george` and `/sarah` will hit the
 // `/:name` route, where `name` is now a key on the `request.params` object)

// Whereas *request.query* represents an _object_ wherein you assign _specific_ 
// values to _specific_ keys via the URI (e.g. on `/?name=george` `request.query.name = george` 
// and this URI is distinct from, say, `/?firstName=george` or `/name=sarah`).


//w/ morgan: 
var morgan = require('morgan');

app.use(morgan('dev'));

//streamlining: 
	//use nodemon module: 

//define a start script: it is common practice to define a start script that handles launch of app.
//therefore npm start will work for any project

//one of package.json's roles is to define scripts.
//add a start property to scripts w the value of 'nodemon app.js'; test in terminal w npm start.

//having diff scripts can be useful. on prodxn server we might prefer node to nodemon; 
//we can have separate scripts for serve vs develop. test script runs our scrips, and so on. 

// WARNING: in larger collaborative Git projects, pushing and pulling to the master branch 
// is generally a bad idea as it will often lead to merge conflicts and other issues. Instead, collaborators 
// make feature branches and submit pull requests for inclusion in the master branch. This is beyond the scope of this
//  workshop, but for now just know to avoid merge conflicts by only working on one machine at a time,
//   pulling at the beginning of a coding session and pushing at the end.

//templating engine:

	//nunjucks:

Take a look at the template markup. Expressions enclosed in {{ ... }} tags are variables, and expressions in {% ... %} are logic tags.

//HTTP: Routing and views
	//HTTP is communications std driving the web; it uses the client-server model.
	//clients request resources from server and server responds with data.
	//reqs and resps have header fields that are technical metadata for the protocol to work.

//HTTP request properties eg
	//URI path (uniform resource identifier)-- eg string label (/tweets/123) -- NOT necessarily a real file path.
	//it's just an identifier.
	//method/verb: identifies what client wants to do with resource; 
		//GET (read), PUT (update), POST (create), DELETE 
	//optional message body containing data (JSON, XML etc)

// HTTP response properties eg
	// - status code indicating how server dealt w req
	// - optional message body containing data

//requesting resource: 
	//type address http://localhost:3000/tweets/5 in browser
	//browser sees it should use http protocol to make and send req 
	//sends VERB-URI request GET /tweets/5 (resource of interest)
	//server listening at that address and port receives the req
	//server code routes the request to the proper handler fn, based on the verb and URI.
	//handler fn runs adn builds response msg (eg status code 200, body <html> an html file showing tweet #5 </html>)
	//server sends response back to browser
	//browser decides what to do w response based on status and body (eg display successful HTML delivery)

//ROUTING
//depending on an HTTP req's method and URI path (eg POST /tweets/), server will
//route the req to a specific fn.

//eg route all requests to a single fn that sends response "under construction"
//eg route GET and POST reqs for /tweets/ to 2 diff fns: one to send HTML page of tweets, another to add tweet to data and send OK status back

//express routes: 
//routing is code that feeds an incoming HTTP req to a specific fn. 
app.METHOD(path, handler) //is how express routes requests.

//GET --> app.get('/', myFunc1);
//app.post('/tweets/', myFunc2);

//handler funcs receive 3 objs: a req obj, a res obj, and a next fn - 
//next fn sends req to next handler in a chain, which is needed for middleware and multi-step routing

//cf controllers in Rails, which handle the business logic and facilitate transfer between data and views. Node calls controllers 'routes'. 
//express can be set up as a basic router or a more complex model-view-controller (MVC) framework

//put routes in a module to avoid polluting app.js with complex routing and business logic.
const routes = require('./routes/');
app.use('/', routes); //this registers routes folder as middleware for everything

//routes/index.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
//could use one line instead: const router = require('express').Router()
const tweetBank = require('../tweetBank');

router.get('/', function(req, res) {
	let tweets = tweetBank.list();
	res.render('index', {tweets: tweets});
});

module.exports = router;

//router.get instead of app.get: 
//express module can create a router entity configurable outside of any app instance.
//router is a BOX for routes; a mini-app capable only of performing middleware and routing fns.
//all the app.VERB fns can be written as router.VERB. We export this router
//so that app.js can use it as a middleware handler for all / routes and subroutes. 

//templates: add style.css to public/stylesheets/
//replace index.html and layout.html in views/
//top of index.html says {% extends "layout.html %}: this is inheritance. 
//when nunjucks goes to render index, it automatically embeds that template inside the layout template and renders both as a singel file.
//other pages will also be able to extend layout in this fashion, so we only have to worry about each page's unique content.
//automatic embedding of unique template is inside the {%block content %} tag. 

//link tags in HTML automatically trigger an HTTP get request to URL assigned to href attribute.
//so long as server responds with a CSS file, al the rules in CSS file are applied to html in our app.
//line 13 gets bootstrap template via BS's content delivery network(CDN). 
//w/no domain name provided when we do href = /stylesheets/style.css, we are make a req to the same server taht served up the index.html file-- our sever.

//writing own middleware for express.static: 
//for every incoming request:
// 1) use request.path to get route
// 2) see if that route maps to a valid file in the public directory 
// 3) if not, go defer to the next matching middleware
// 4) if the file matches, send over its contents

What's this new :name part of the URI? The colon : is a trick that Express provides to define particular portions of the URI string as variables. In other words, in users/:name, the :name portion can be anything. Such URL parameters are detected and stored as properties of the req.params object:

// say that a client GET requests the path /users/nimit
router.get( '/users/:name', function (req, res) {
  console.log( req.params.name ); // --> 'nimit'
});
Here are some more examples to make this clear.

router.get( '/store/:product/reviews/:id', function (req, res) {
  // use req.params here
});

//======REVIEW NOTES ============
//when we start a node program, we always start at one place: app.js eg
//nodemon does automatic refreshing and keeps process running 

//const is block-scoped, and you can never reassign variable. 
//so if you use it in if statement block it will just never be available outside that

//server/client 
	//at start of program, your server is a process that lives on a network and receives msgs via HTTP
	//your browser sends GET to remote server when you try to access a URL 
	//client: browser. browser receives response from server and goes through browser's embedded software and modules to render the HTML response from server and create it.
	//the server only serves up HTML; client takes it from there.
	//localhost is 127.0.0.1 -- for every unix computer, this means 'self' 
	//doesn't make the server less remote than if it was at a different IP. 
	//even though it's running on same computer and browser, it is very very far away. 
	//the browser and node process don't have any direct contact; their only communication is
	//through HTTP messages sent by browser or Postman. 

//app in express is like a pipeline. 
	//you can build a server w node without express: 
	//but it will be less abstracted and more raw: you need HTTP module 
	//and doing simple things will be harder than in express.

	//reasons to use node w/o express: optimize performance for a computer that can't handle expres
	//notwithstanding hardware constraints, it makes a lot of sense to use express
		//does simple things easily: establish routes, render data

	//after we use pipeline.listen, it takes the built-in HTTP library from Node and builds a server
	//cf express source code

	//express doesn't allow us to have servers; it just allows us to organize requests and responses in a more featureful way.

	//you attach an express pipeline to an HTTP server and you can specify that every request sent to 
	//that port will go through the pipeline in the order that you specify. 




	//all middleware fns like volleyball and morgan can be used like so:
	pipeline.use(function(req, res, next) {
		volleyball(req, res);
		next(); //this passes control to next handler in the pipeline. 
	}); 

	app.use(function(req,res, next) {
		if(req.method === "GET" && req.url === '/') {
			/*...*/
		} else {
			res.render(/*...*/)
			next(); //res.render is a more featureful implementation of res.send
			//res.render is not a return statement. but it does fulfill the response. 
			//if you reach end of pipeline and pop out, you get 404 
			//so you will get two responses generated: one to do res.render and one for 
			//404. Express has somethign implemented where you won't get a 404 if you have something already 
			//generated. 
		}
	});

	//above is the same as 
	app.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
		/*...*/
	});

	//404 handling:
	pipeline.use(function(req, res, next) {
		res.status(404).send('Cannot GET /');
	}); //if you apply this, you will get error "can't set headers after they are sent" -- 
	//this means generally that you are generating two responses for one request, which is 
	//outside the protocol for HTTP. 

	//express allows you to use subrouters to organize routes into categories
	//eg for ecommerce store, have separate cart operation route, user route, product route
//usually you will not have more than 4-5 subrouters for an app. 

	//in routes/index.js, create router and then export it to app.js
	//require('path') always uses relative path

	require('./routes/index.js') //.js is redundant; it's always assumed.
	//also, index is redundant; if you require a directory it will go by default to find
	//index.js file. But this only works for files named index.js

	//nunjucks and templating 
		//view configuration, not part of pipeline!
		nunjucks.configure('views', {noCache: true});
		pipeline.set('view engine', 'html'); //have res.render work with html files
		pipeline.engine('html', nunjucks.render); //when giving html files to res.render tells it to use nunjucks render to smash together stuff
		//end view configuration

		//bc we embed templates in frontend with react, this strategy is not our end goal.
	//nunjucks is an express-agnostic tool; we use it to describe a file with delimiters like {%%} - writing out for loop or interpolating data
	//res.render('name')... means find 'views/name' and render it using the specified rendering engine. 
	//nocache means don't reuse what you read before because you dont want changes to be cached and not reflected.
	//so in development it's better to use nocache. 

	// res.render specifies a template file and some data, nunjucks smashes together data, express renders it using nunjucks engine 

	//for _.cloneDeep we want to make a deep copy because we don't want to return the actual data object
	//in case it gets corrupted 
		//we do clone deep because it does recursive copying- can go deep within 
		//and produce an entirely new, contents-included, data set.
		//if we did just shallow copy the only new thing would be top-level array, so 
		//when we go deeper it's the same objects in original data array. 

	tweetBank.list() //gives list of data 

//built-in library path: 
	dirName = directory of filewe're authoring right now.
	subRouter.get('/stylesheets/style.css', function(req, res, next) {
		res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../stylesheets/style.css'));
	}); //this can get laborious if you need to create a handler for EVERY SINGLE FILE.
	//that's why we use static routing

	//pipeline ordering: 
	//place first the elmts that are most likely to generate responses, so piepline doesn't get run down 
	//a lot inefficiently


	const theTweet = tweetBank.find({id: parseInt(req.params.id, 10)});
	//because params.id is a string and id is a number, you need to parseInt 


	//POST and PUT are two methods with PAYLOAD body- 
	// to convey extra info w a get request you need a query string or using req.params. 
		//form data payload: post request such as posting text to form includes this.
		//by default, with express, the payload is not parsed out. 
		//that's why we need to use bodyparser. 
	//use network tab in google dev tools to see status, pages and routes

	//add showForm: true to rendering to make form show

	//2 formats for payload: JSON (main way to send POST and PUT requests) and urlencoded
	app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded()); //parses to req.body; 
	//it never generates a request but it modifies the body 
		res.redirect('/');
	//use this after a post request to redirect to homepage. Express makes this a lot easier than it woudl be with just regular node.
